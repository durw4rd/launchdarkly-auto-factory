/**
 * Evidence for judges: the agent's ACTUAL changes, not its self-report.
 *
 * The judge otherwise sees only the brief the agent received and the agent's
 * final message — so a polished-but-wrong report could score well. This
 * collector gives the judge hook ground truth: a node-scoped `git diff` of
 * exactly the commits the just-finished agent landed.
 *
 * Node scoping works by snapshotting HEAD when the collector is created (before
 * the chain runs) and advancing the snapshot on every call: each call diffs
 * lastSeenHead..HEAD, which is precisely the commits made since the previous
 * judged node. "No new commits" is itself evidence (e.g. an honest skip).
 *
 * Defensive throughout: any git failure yields undefined (judge runs without
 * evidence) rather than breaking the evaluation.

/**
 * Working-tree analog of `createGitDiffEvidence`, for front ends that run with

 * never commit, so commit-scoped evidence would report "no new commits" for
 * every node. This snapshots the set of dirty/untracked files (with content
 * hashes) and, per call, returns the diff-vs-HEAD of exactly the files whose
 * content changed since the previous judged node. Untracked files don't appear
 * in `git diff HEAD`, so their contents are appended as new-file sections (the
 * release manifest lands this way).
 *
 * It ALSO tracks HEAD: if commits landed since the previous call, their
 * node-scoped diff is included too. "Normally never commit" failed once in the
 * wild — a Cursor local agent committed each step via its native git, the tree
 * was clean at every judge call, and judges scored honest work 0.00 on "no
 * working-tree changes" evidence. Whoever moves the tree OR the history, the
 * evidence stays truthful.
